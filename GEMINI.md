# GEMINI.md - Instructional Context for AI Agent

This file serves as the definitive reference and context for any AI Agent working in this repository. It defines the project's technology stack, architecture, standard development workflows, and coding conventions.

---

## 1. Development Conventions

To maintain a cohesive and robust codebase, all agents must rigorously adhere to the active coding guidelines and constraints defined in `@AGENTS.md` at the repo root.

### Rendering Rules

- **Astro SSR Mode**: The application runs under "server" mode. All pages are server-rendered by default.
- **Serverless API Routes**: API endpoints must live in `src/pages/api/` and must export standard uppercase HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`). They must export `const prerender = false`. Use `zod` to validate all incoming inputs.
- **Islands Architecture**: Use Astro components for static layouts and content. Transition to React components _only_ when client-side interactivity is necessary.

### Coding Practices & Guidelines

- **Path Aliases**: Always use the `@/*` alias mapping to `./src/*` instead of relative paths (e.g., import from `@/lib/supabase`).
- **No Next.js Directives**: Do not write "use client" or "use server" directives in React files. These are not supported or needed by Astro's island architecture.
- **Tailwind Class Merging**: Always use the `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` (which wraps `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`) when conditionally merging classes or overriding components. Avoid manual concatenation of Tailwind utility classes.
- **UI Components**: Build or add new design primitives under `src/components/ui/` using shadcn/ui. Install via `npx shadcn@latest add [name]` following the `new-york` style variant.
- **Extracting Hooks & Logic**:
  - React hooks should be isolated and saved in `src/components/hooks/`.
  - Service modules, API integrators, and helper logic belong in `src/lib/` or `src/lib/services/`.
  - Shared typescript entities and data transfer object (DTO) models should be saved in `src/types.ts`.

### Database Migrations

- Write new schema modifications as SQL migration files under `supabase/migrations/` using the exact file name convention: `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`.
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: RLS must be explicitly enabled on all newly created tables. Every table must define granular, secure policies mapping actions to specific roles (e.g., authenticated users).

### Code Quality & Validation

- **CI Safety**: A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs verification tests (`npm run lint` and `npm run build`) on every push or pull request to the `master` branch.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated git hooks (Husky + lint-staged) execute before every commit:
  - Runs `eslint --fix` on `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, and `*.astro` files.
  - Runs `prettier --write` on `*.json`, `*.css`, and `*.md` files.

## 2. Project Overview

### Purpose

The **10x Astro Starter** is a modern, opinionated starter template designed for building highly performant, server-first, type-safe web applications deployed on edge runtimes. It is built to optimize developer productivity and deliver polished, fast, and accessible user experiences.

### Key Technologies

- **Framework**: [Astro v6](https://astro.build/) in Server-Side Rendering (SSR) mode (`output: "server"`).
- **Frontend Islands**: [React v19](https://react.dev/) (used selectively for interactive islands).
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (integrated via `@tailwindcss/vite`).
- **Type Safety**: [TypeScript v5](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (strict mode configured via `astro/tsconfigs/strict`).
- **Backend & Authentication**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (using `@supabase/ssr` for cookie-based session management).
- **Deployment & Runtime**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (using the serverless and edge-native runtime via the `@astrojs/vercel` adapter).

## 3. Building and Running

Ensure you have **Node.js v22.14.0** installed. Local database operations require **Docker** with at least ~7 GB of RAM allocated.

### Core CLI Scripts

Refer directly to `@package.json` scripts for all available commands. The most common commands are:

- `npm run dev` — Start the local development server.
- `npm run build` — Compile the production build.
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint across the codebase.
- `npm run format` — Run Prettier formatting.

### Database & Environment Setup

1. **Credentials Setup**:
   - Local Node/Supabase: copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. **Local Supabase Start**:
   - Initialize Supabase project (if not already initialized): `npx supabase init`
   - Spin up Docker-based Supabase stack: `npx supabase start`
   - Copy the printed endpoint/key credentials directly into `.env`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 5

Pick a deployment platform and ship to production with the **infra chain**:

```
(/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd  →  /10x-tech-stack-selector  →  /10x-bootstrapper  →  /10x-agents-md  →  /10x-rule-review  →  /10x-lesson)  →  /10x-infra-research  →  Plan Mode deploy
```

The full Module 1 chain ships from Lessons 1–4 (re-included so you can fix any earlier contract mid-flight). `/10x-infra-research` is the lesson's main topic; the deploy step itself uses the host's built-in **Plan Mode** rather than a dedicated skill — the artifact (`context/deployment/deploy-plan.md`) is what carries forward.

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-infra-research` reads `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` (language, framework, runtime, database) as **hard constraints** — platforms that can't run the stack are dropped before scoring. It also reads `context/foundation/prd.md` (scale, latency, uptime expectations) as **soft weights** when scoring. Both inputs are optional but strongly recommended; without them the skill proceeds but warns.
- The skill writes `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` as the third foundation contract: frontmatter (`project`, `researched_at`, `recommended_platform`, `runner_up`, `context_type`, `tech_stack`) plus a body covering recommendation, full platform comparison with scoring matrix, anti-bias findings, operational story (preview / secrets / rollback / approval / logs), and a risk register tying every entry back to the lens that surfaced it. On collision the skill prompts: overwrite, save as `infrastructure-v2.md`, or abort.
- Plan Mode reads `infrastructure.md` and `tech-stack.md` together. The agent emits a step-by-step plan covering automated steps it owns, manual setup gates (account creation, secret configuration), exact deploy commands (Pages vs Workers commands are NOT interchangeable on Cloudflare — the plan must specify), and verification steps. The plan is rejected/edited until it's right; only then does Plan Mode exit and execution begin. The approved plan lands at `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` and is consumed downstream by milestone-planning skills as ground truth for "what's already deployed".

### What the lesson's skills capture (and what they do NOT)

- **`/10x-infra-research` captures**: platform shortlist scored against five agent-friendly criteria (CLI quality, managed/serverless degree, agent-readable docs, stable/scriptable deploy API, MCP or first-class agent integration), three anti-bias outputs on the leader (numbered weaknesses, 150–200-word failure narrative, 3–5 unknown-unknowns), an operational story with one concrete answer per axis (not categories), and a risk register where every row names its source lens (`Devil's advocate` / `Pre-mortem` / `Unknown unknowns` / `Research finding`). Status of every non-GA feature is captured inline (`beta` / `preview` / `region-limited` / `deprecated`) with the date the status was checked.
- **`/10x-infra-research` does NOT** build Docker images or write Dockerfiles, configure CI/CD pipelines, or plan beyond MVP scope (multi-region HA is explicitly out of scope). It does NOT decide for you — the user accepts, swaps to runner-up, or aborts after the cross-check, and that decision is recorded in the output.
- **Plan Mode** captures: an explicit human gate between "agent has a plan" and "agent mutates production". The artifact (`deploy-plan.md`) is the audit trail for "what was supposed to happen" when the live run goes sideways. Plan Mode does NOT replace `/10x-infra-research` (the platform decision must already be made — Plan Mode plans the deploy, it doesn't pick where to deploy).

### The five agent-friendly criteria (and why they're load-bearing)

The criteria that make `/10x-infra-research`'s scoring matrix are not generic "good platform" axes — they're the specific traits that determine whether an agent can operate this platform from a session without you holding its hand:

1. **CLI-first** — every routine operation has a documented command; the agent doesn't need to click in a panel.
2. **Managed / serverless** — fewer moving pieces means fewer ways the agent (or you) breaks something the platform was supposed to handle.
3. **Agent-readable docs** — markdown / `llms.txt` / GitHub-hosted docs the agent can fetch and parse, not JS-rendered marketing pages.
4. **Stable, scriptable deploy API** — predictable exit codes, structured output, no interactive prompts mid-deploy.
5. **MCP server or first-class agent integration** — bonus, not required. CLI alone is fine for MVP; MCP earns its keep when the agent makes dozens of structured queries against live state.

Hard filters apply before scoring (persistent-connection requirement drops Netlify/Vercel serverless-only; tech-stack runtime mismatch drops the platform entirely). Interview answers reweight criteria after — cost sensitivity penalizes expensive base tiers, familiarity breaks ties, global-reach preference favours edge-native platforms, co-location preference favours integrated databases.

### Anti-bias as a decision discipline (not theatre)

Every research conversation with an LLM has a built-in tilt toward whatever the user already signalled. `/10x-infra-research` runs three structured lenses against the leader BEFORE the file is written, not after:

- **Devil's advocate** — _find the weaknesses, hidden costs, and failure modes specific to deploying `<this stack>` on `<this platform>`_. Output is a numbered list of 3–5 specifics, not categories.
- **Pre-mortem** — _six months later, this decision turned out to be a complete disaster; walk through the assumptions and underestimated risks that led there_. Output is a 150–200-word narrative; narratives surface concrete failure shapes that abstract risk lists hide.
- **Unknown unknowns** — _what's true about this combination that the marketing page and docs don't make obvious?_ Output is 3–5 non-obvious risks.

After the cross-check the user has three real options: **proceed with the leader and absorb the risks into the register**, **swap to runner-up** (and re-run the cross-check on the new leader), or **swap to third place**. The third option is rare; if it never happens across many runs, the cross-check has degraded into a ritual and should be rewritten.

Two additional techniques (no skill required, raw prompts) belong in the same toolbox: forcing the model to compare three alternatives in a markdown table (structure beats "the same answer in different words"), and role-rotation (the same decision through a frontend dev's, security person's, and cost owner's eyes — surface the cost each role pays and propose alternatives if any of them flinch).

### CLI vs MCP for live-infra operability

After deploy, the agent needs a way to talk to the running platform. Two paths, complementary not competing:

- **CLI** (`wrangler`, `flyctl`, `vercel`, `gh`) — explicit and auditable, output stays in the terminal, safer defaults for irreversible actions (e.g. `netlify deploy` is draft by default; `--prod` must be passed). Best for MVP: minimal setup, low context cost (no tool schemas pre-loaded), and the agent has to know the command (which is where a per-tool skill helps).
- **MCP** — a dedicated server exposing structured tools with schemas (`pages_deployments_list`, etc.). Each connected MCP server adds tool definitions to the context window, so cost compounds across servers. Earns its keep when the agent makes many discovery-style queries against live state (logs, deployment diffs) and structured JSON beats parsing CLI output.

Sensible default: start with CLI, add MCP when you notice a recurring pattern of `--help` traversal the agent has to do to answer a class of questions. Anthropic's own [building-agents-that-reach-production](https://claude.com/blog/building-agents-that-reach-production-systems-with-mcp) framing is "API, CLI, and MCP are three complementary paths" — pick by task, not by hype.

### Production-access boundary (minimal permissions, human-on-irreversibles)

Both CLI and MCP can give the agent direct access to production. The lesson sets a default posture:

- **Tokens are scoped, not master keys.** On Cloudflare: an API token limited to Pages or Workers for one project, no DNS, no Workers Secrets for unrelated projects, no billing. AWS / GCP equivalent: scoped IAM role with `console-only-user` or read-only on production, full access on staging.
- **Tokens live in env vars, not in `.mcp.json` committed to the repo.** The agent picks them up via the MCP server or CLI's env-discovery, not via plaintext in conversation.
- **Destructive actions are human-only.** Drop a database, rotate a primary secret, delete a project — those are panel-by-hand operations, even if the agent suggests them. Manual click costs 30 seconds; cleanup after an automated mistake costs hours.

This is the MVP posture. As the project matures, the natural evolution is staging gets full agent access, production becomes read-only — covered in later modules.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — input (Lesson 2 hand-off, hard constraints)
- `context/foundation/prd.md` — input (Lesson 1 hand-off, soft weights)
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` — output (the third foundation contract)
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` — output of Plan Mode deploy (audit trail of "what was supposed to happen")
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls (use `/10x-lesson` from Lesson 4 if you spot a class of agent failure during research or deploy)
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry

### Universal language

The shipped skill carries no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The candidate platform list (Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, Fly.io, Railway, Render) is the starting research lens, not a recommendation set — the scoring + interview + cross-check pipeline is what's load-bearing, and a platform absent from the default list can be added by extending the research step. The five agent-friendly criteria are the artifact's true core; `/10x-infra-research` re-reads them from `references/agent-friendly-criteria.md` so they evolve as platforms do.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
